												<p>This is in relation to the Great Australian Bite (GAB) Marine Survey
													2
													procurement conducted by the Commonwealth Science and Industrial
													Research
													Organisation (CSIRO). The project aimed to research natural
													resources
													available in the GAB to a depth of 3000 meters below sea level. The
													final
													value of the procurement was $7.3m.</p>
												<p>The business unit (GAB Project team) undertook limited market
													research and
													proposed to approach only one provider to undertake the work.</p>
											</div>
										</div>

										<div class="row nx-tab-margin">
											<div class="col-sm-12">
												<p>CSIRO scientists have a strong understanding of this type of project
													as it is
													highly specialised. They received specific external funding to
													undertake
													this type of research. Often, they draw on past experience or the
													knowledge
													of other scientists in CSIRO to find a solution. This can lead to
													limited
													tender procurements, avoiding open tender processes and limiting
													innovation
													and competition in the market.</p>
												<p>As this was a procurement of a charter of a research vessel, the
													market is
													limited but providers are available internationally (e.g. Singapore,
													US,
													Europe). The business unit was seeking to engage a provider using
													exemption
													4 of the CPR’s – “procurements funded by grants and sponsorship
													payments
													from non-Commonwealth entities” – as the GAB Survey was funded by an
													external partner.</p>
												<p>There were several concerns with this approach, including: </p>
												<ul>
													<li>once the funding for the project ($20m) was transferred to CSIRO
														it
														became CSIRO appropriation and therefore the exemption did not
														apply (in
														its intent – the funding was not a grant or sponsorship rather a
														payment
														for services delivered by CSIRO as the partner in the project)
													</li>
													<li>the business unit could not adequately demonstrate that the use
														of one
														provider met any exemption or limited tender condition, due to
														limited
														market research</li>
													<li>the CSIRO, as Australia’s innovation catalysts, should be taking
														every
														opportunity to engage with industry to encourage competition
													</li>
												</ul>
												<p>As a result, the limited tender/exemption request was not approved,
													and an
													open tender was recommended.</p>
												<p>The sourcing team worked with the GAB project team to develop scope,
													outcomes
													and tender documentation, which was released to the market via an
													open
													tender.</p>
												<p>The team was pleasantly surprised when this competitive approach
													generated
													several compelling responses, including the initially identified
													supplier
													offering an alternative bid. This bid outlined a new to market
													solution that
													would allow underwater exploration to beyond 3000m below sea level.
													This had
													never been done before, however, the solution would take several
													months to
													fully develop.</p>
												<p>Following the evaluation process, however, another bid demonstrated a
													better
													value for money solution.  The alternate bid submitted by the
													initially
													identified potential supplier could not be utilised because of
													compelling
													time constraints around the need to enter the GAB in a small window
													of time.
													This did not allow development of the new solution.</p>

											<div class="col-sm-12">
												<p>The main hiccups were demonstrating to the business unit that
													conducting
													appropriate early market research and going to open market were not
													tools to
													make their lives difficult but that can be used to actively engage
													with the
													market to encourage innovation in the sector and discover solutions
													that
													were previously unknown.</p>
												<p>In debriefing with the business unit, they noted how excited they
													were to
													receive the alternate bid but how disappointed they were as they
													were not
													able to use it due to the time constraints.</p>
												<p>Had they conducted the early market research prior to formulating a
													view of
													the market and spending valuable time pursuing that view, they may
													have had
													opportunity to utilise the new technology within their timeframe.
												</p>
												<p>Engaging early with the Strategic Procurement Team would also have
													greatly
													assisted the team in navigating the sourcing landscape and
													understanding the
													rich opportunities available when seeking innovative solutions to
													problems.
												</p>
												<p>As a result of the experience, the team advised they would be
													engaging with
													the Strategic Procurement Team in the early stages of planning their
													projects so they can better engage with industry in the future.</p>
												<p>Here are some top tips from the experience:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>engaging early with the internal sourcing teams is strategically
														beneficial to the organisation and supports a value for money
														outcome
													</li>
													<li>early engagement with industry promotes innovation and allows
														scope for
														new to market solutions</li>
													<li>a fully functional strategic sourcing team is an enabler rather
														than a
														blocker and by effectively navigating the resource management
														framework,
														the Australian government can produce innovation through early
														market
														research and engagement, and via open approaches to market</li>

												<p class="border-bottom"><strong>What was the project?</strong></p>
												<p>We had an idea to develop a digital messaging network in Queensland
													that
													would provide customer updates, information and advertising.  It
													would be
													free to the department and could possibly even generate some
													revenue.</p>
												<p class="border-bottom"><strong>Was it a large project?</strong></p>
												<p>We were unsure of the size in the early stages — We were thinking of
													doing an
													initial phase which focused on Gold Coast light rail and a few of
													major
													motorways in South East Queensland. Then later, expanding the scope
													to the
													whole state of Queensland (roads and buses).</p>
												<p class="border-bottom"><strong>Why did you do early market
														research?</strong>
												</p>
												<p>We had a vague idea around the sort of technology which was available
													and the
													scope of what we wanted.  However, we didn’t know if there were
													other
													technologies and we wanted to explore further. We also wanted to
													find out
													who the main suppliers were in the market and better understand each
													technology. All this information would then inform the Department’s
													decision as to the direction we would take with the available
													technology, including whether or not to even conduct a procurement —
													And if we were to procure, which type of procurement method and how
													best to approach the market.</p>

											<div class="col-sm-12">
												<p class="border-bottom"><strong>How were sellers
														researched/located?</strong>
												</p>
												<p>There were some existing sellers that we were aware of (major
													advertising
													companies in Brisbane) and these were invited directly to
													participate. To
													cast a wider net, we also published an early market research Brief
													on ‘QTenders’ and Commonwealth Digital Marketplace websites.</p>
												<p class="border-bottom"><strong>How were sellers contacted?</strong>
												</p>
												<p>We asked sellers for written submissions in response to the Brief. We
													treated
													the early market research process as per normal procurement and
													probity
													guidelines — With fairness and transparency.</p>
												<p>We did the evaluation step in two stages:</p>
												<ol>
													<li>First, we shortlisted written submissions.</li>
													<li>Second, we had face-to face meetings with shortlisted companies
														and
														evaluated again (using a weighted method — where each criteria
														in the
														evaluation report has a different weight, and we marked the
														degree to
														which each seller met each criteria).</li>
												</ol>
												<p class="border-bottom"><strong>How did you mitigate probity
														risks?</strong>
												</p>
												<p>An independent probity advisor was hired, and they participated in
													the
													process from the onset, where they reviewed the early market
													research Brief, to the very end when they produced a Probity Report
													confirming all probity principles were upheld.</p>
												<p class="border-bottom"><strong>How was it all documented? </strong>
												</p>
												<p>We documented the research using the following Department templates:
												</p>
												<ul>
													<li>Written Brief (all supporting approval documents in the
														background)</li>
													<li>Evaluation sheets and Evaluation Reports for both stages</li>
													<li>Meeting minutes</li>
													<li>Final Evaluation Report and Recommendation (as to next steps)
													</li>
													<li>Probity Report</li>
												</ul>
												<p class="border-bottom"><strong>What were the outcomes?</strong></p>
												<p>We formulated recommendations about what to do next.</p>
												<p>There were two companies that could do what we wanted and they were
													ready to
													start implementing a solution within the Department’s timeline.</p>
												<p>Some other sellers proposed fairly risky approaches, and it was
													recommended
													to further engage with these sellers better understand the risks.
												</p>
												<p>The next step was to develop a budget bid to get funding to enable
													the next
													procurement step.  The market research was invaluable in formulating
													a
													picture of the potential costs involved in the solution we were
													seeking and shaping the formal approach to market.</p>
												<p>We also discovered that Queensland Rail were conducting their own
													project
													with similar goals.</p>

												<p class="border-bottom"><strong>Were there any hiccups along the
														way?</strong>
												</p>
												<p>One challenge we had along the way was some resistance from the
													probity
													advisor. They took a very compliance-based approach and provided
													advice on ways in which we could not do things. Perhaps a more
													constructive approach would have been to also provide feedback on
													navigating the probity concerns while reaching a compliant, timely
													outcome.</p>
												<p class="border-bottom"><strong>Were there any lessons we could learn
														from?</strong></p>
												<p>We found the most value in terms of time, responsiveness and
													information
													gathered was to prioritise in person meetings, rather than just
													receiving written submissions. In face-to-face meetings, valuable
													insights emerged that we wouldn’t have otherwise obtained. Suppliers
													will often send written
													presentations or documentation following a face-to-face meeting so
													you have
													access to the important information after the meetings.</p>
												<p class="border-bottom"><strong>Any ‘top tips’ for others who may go
														through this process?</strong></p>
												<p>My top tip is to focus on encouraging and empowering internal
													resources to
													focus on a timely, compliant outcome.  To think of innovative
													approaches, which remain compliant while also achieving your desired
													outcomes.  Another tip is to actively engage with the risks –
													Identifying and treating them.  Being able to articulate the risks
													of an early market research activity will assist with probity
													concerns and provide defensible evidence should issues arise.</p>
												<p class="border-bottom"><strong>Anything else to add?</strong></p>
												<p>We’re now doing another early market research process for a 5G
													deployment
													project. It is in the initial phases and we are using the same
													templates and
													processes. As with the case study, this approach is expected to
													uncover new
													technologies and solutions to better inform the formal approach to
													market

												<p>Seller A was the incumbent supplier and Seller B was identified

												<p>Following assessment, Seller B was set aside from further

												<p>In summary:  In line with the identified risks and the small scale of
